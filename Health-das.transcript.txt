WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.429
Recording. Yes.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.649
Okay.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.020
The problem again. What's the problem. What are we trying to solve. Let's do everything again so that you have fresh ideas. Yes. Yeah.

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.920
Yeah.

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
So to start the problem to start the problem with currently

6
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.810
How the Health Dashboard should be shown to any end user. That is a big definition of the problem.

7
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.410
Then, there comes the detailed description like

8
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.350
If I am seeing

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.860
The dashboard as to how user like what components are what metrics are what else should I be seeing ID on

10
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.350
The second point is what if

11
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.150
My memory.

12
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.690
Is blonde to us. So in a particular instance that is a second second part of the problem.

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.970
Okay, so let's start with the first part of the problem where what we want to see.

14
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.870
End user

15
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.660
The end. Everything is end user like

16
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.080
Hot

17
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.180
Water and you have everything. Okay.

18
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:48.960
So let's, let's not think about exactly what Tom. Let's think about in general, I would say we can approach it that way is also that, what do we want the Health dashboard to be look like because it's going to an extra instance

19
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.940
How generate it should be. What is the necessary part. And what is a good to have fun.

20
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.560
Yes, right.

21
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.020
So number one, what I feel.

22
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.930
Sorry, is the ability

23
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.150
Is the ability

24
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.110
To change the root group.

25
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.570
Okay.

26
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.740
Right, one

27
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.530
Will you start with some ideas. And then we counter ourselves and see

28
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.980
Ya.

29
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.200
realty to change the root.

30
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.750
Of the

31
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.670
Health dashboard.

32
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.020
Or the whole group.

33
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.930
Of the Health dashboard.

34
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.520
Right.

35
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:45.870
Yes, that's one. That's a if we give that what we achieve is any user comes, he might be seeing, whatever. Let's say if we have just this feature, he might be seeing whatever he can just stay. Okay, this is my route.

36
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.000
And

37
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.870
You show him the services or the groups under that sub tree so him everything under that sub tree right

38
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.900
Okay.

39
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.960
So let's say if we just give this feature. Let's assume this like all we give is the ability for him to change the root of the Health dashboard.

40
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.340
And it's like a group

41
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.520
And when I say any group, we only say groups which are at a level three or more

42
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.410
Correct. So

43
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.810
If I say, level one is the leaves in level two and so on and so forth.

44
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.750
So level three and above, you can say

45
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.360
In bracket can select any group of level three and above.

46
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.110
Yes.

47
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.670
And the top you can say what should be seen by default, you can say in the Health Dashboard. So what we're talking is very specific to

48
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.200
Hide will grab everything is helpful reading all yeah so because

49
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.410
We're not talking something that can be applied somewhere else. Because right now, specific and goal is to do the minimum

50
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:27.000
Needed but also the best experience that we can provide. So it's like a best rate of in terms of the effort and the way you know

51
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:39.000
So, so, okay, what is the problem that you guys see now if we give just this feature. What is the issue. So first issue is a user will have to change it every time.

52
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.450
Hmm, it will come in, always see service engineering

53
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.250
Or some fixed thing.

54
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.770
Okay, yeah.

55
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:55.260
Okay, and then, like, okay, before that, what we can say is another thing this too, if we have user preferences showed

56
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.600
Hmm, that's what we said right

57
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.780
Yeah, user can set his route once and we store that as a user preference.

58
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.870
Hmm, okay. Yeah, so

59
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.660
Just trying to follow the natural line of thought.

60
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.220
One after the other.

61
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.970
Any, anything you guys want to say that or do you think

62
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.810
It.

63
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.370
Was the same thing that we have to discuss

64
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.530
Let's, let's go along the natural line of thought and then we counter ourselves. We'll see how it goes.

65
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.460
So,

66
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.520
The first thing that we can say is if we store.

67
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.780
Store the user selected route.

68
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.370
As a user preference.

69
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.860
Okay, let

70
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.940
Me see

71
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:53.970
Just do ABC. There is no big deal. So just points, we'll see how to Section eight on indented. You can store the last user selected last

72
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.430
Group.

73
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.310
As a user preference for example.

74
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.170
Yes.

75
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.850
Okay.

76
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.030
So next time he comes, we automatically know is selected group and he can always go back and change.

77
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.240
Yeah, and I've used to that as his user preference. Okay. Okay.

78
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.530
That's number two.

79
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.400
This is by default. Ok, ok, continue putting

80
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.020
Less than giving ourselves time to think. Also, so it's

81
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.940
Getting

82
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.540
So know that is so it's on the dashboard that he gets up, select the group is

83
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.160
Yes, that that brutal naughty.

84
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.220
Nobody has food as well conference calls.

85
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.240
That's what, that's what I'm just

86
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.690
Has to come to the dashboard and that's how we take it.

87
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:13.260
Okay. So number two. Now, now we are going in the more of a feature thing and this is not a mandate, but we are going to more feature.

88
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.180
Because

89
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.650
If

90
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.180
You have too many of the groups and there's too much noise on the Health Dashboard somebody

91
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:31.680
You know, we are saying is number you can write is a ability to remove some groups from this page right

92
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.760
Here to remove certain notes from the sub tree that is groups certain groups.

93
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.720
And you can say in the bracket Level two groups because all we are showing anybody is level like

94
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.190
A local level.

95
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:58.590
And if it is level five be show Level two groups. Right, right. Now again, because we are trying to actually what's possible with the current thing and you're not trying to build too much.

96
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.830
We will remove

97
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.730
Yeah, so basically it's a it's a filter or at the end of you that is created for himself.

98
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:10.440
Right.

99
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.670
With f f you write a point. So, in short, we are a user has the ability to create his own views.

100
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:30.180
Right, because we are giving the able to select the route and then filter out or select only what he wants to see in that

101
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.560
Yeah. Now, what I'm saying is, other the natural

102
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.570
natural next step is for him the ability to save his views.

103
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.500
Like okay right now, what we're saying is, OK, we have only one view saved as a user preferences. The last view.

104
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.820
That you did.

105
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:55.230
Not write it as a separate step blanket because we might choose not to do the second part, you know,

106
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.960
The ability to save the view.

107
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.660
And by default we show you the last view that you had

108
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.000
Last few by default.

109
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.900
Okay, okay. Now, now, next point. Okay, don't, don't, right under he

110
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.770
Enter, Enter. I wanted to enters

111
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:40.410
Good. Now the next thing is, okay, why are we even allowing him to do the step be if we know what his job. He is gonna be, you know,

112
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.740
By default, will show everybody services during

113
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.580
Hmm, that is the thing I want to improve on.

114
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:59.430
Why should we show everybody service engineering by default when we know that this guy has nothing to do with any of the services or group inside service.

115
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.070
Okay.

116
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.910
Next to the party.

117
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.350
She came she on boarded few of the services from si

118
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.560
And you have a different or the structure altogether.

119
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.870
Okay, or let's say blanket.

120
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.370
Right devalue it comes to so uh

121
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.390
Huh, why am I showing him the entire service engineering dashboards.

122
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.400
Okay. Hey,

123
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.450
When it

124
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.880
Comes I should show him.

125
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.860
Only

126
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.380
Is

127
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.240
Shared Services thing.

128
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.500
Okay.

129
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.390
Getting it. Yeah.

130
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:45.540
So that's why we're saying we want default view so that you can say personalized us

131
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.560
Okay, we have implemented it partially

132
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.170
Right personalized views we have implemented it partially

133
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:12.330
Personalized not personalized so personalized out of the box views. You can see personalized OB use for user perfect skin liquid. Oh my god, you can put a tab and we write us point and the ref, okay.

134
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.000
Obviously, I'm getting

135
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.090
You have to come to a decision of what our default is he can always change.

136
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.920
Huh, what we provide and save as the new right

137
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:44.550
So what is our default logic to fit the views of the or scissor two things selected for the user and filter the groups that is again what we have to do. And then that user can do all we need to do is create a view with the name personalized view for him.

138
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:53.280
Okay, you can, we can call it OB personalized, something like that, just for the sake of our discussion.

139
00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:02.400
Hmm, and that is something that's always available to her, and it's a dynamic view with changes as his membership changes.

140
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.440
Right.

141
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.150
Oh, this

142
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.340
Is the default view which

143
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.750
Is dynamically as his group membership changes across the board.

144
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:21.330
Correct. And he cannot edit this this view, this is out of the box. He can edit and create new views. No issues.

145
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.250
Right, so

146
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:33.870
We can again discuss about it and think about it, how to go about whether we can change the same or not. But let's assume for now that this is the view.

147
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.630
Yeah. Yes. And it is for now. It's an editable read only.

148
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.290
Okay. And we so simple. What I am proposing a, let's say you guys can counter

149
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.680
Is find that users highest hierarchy.

150
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.430
Huh. Okay. Find that users highest hierarchy is highest level.

151
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.960
Yes.

152
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.970
That he has any role to

153
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.440
See me, but I don't bother owner. I don't bother contributor. I don't bother viewer.

154
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.030
Okay.

155
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.860
So he is the owner contributor viewer doesn't matter to me.

156
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:30.900
Just find his highest and parent means the highest level node that he is a member of and said that as the route group.

157
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.450
Only if

158
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:43.620
It's not loving. So that's always the case. But if if he's not a member of level three and above, then I'll find the

159
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.610
Nearest ancestor of level three and show at that level.

160
00:13:49.830 --> 00:14:02.070
Let's say he is not only a service. Okay, yes I I traveled up the tree from this node up and find the first level three node cause a route has to be at least level three.

161
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.960
Correct. So

162
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:12.180
I find the earliest of I find the answer levels, the ancestor for the service or for all the services.

163
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.110
Hmm, let's see another point. Let's say he is an owner

164
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:24.450
He's in honor of I'm, I'm just saying, I'm just making it up. He's an owner

165
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.130
Of

166
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.320
So, let's say, and also a contributor to NSA

167
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.420
Okay, okay.

168
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:42.510
How's it log into two different level three groups. This one is log into

169
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.390
Now automation, for example.

170
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.790
Long into something like

171
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.950
In front of you.

172
00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:51.570
Okay.

173
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.920
So I go up and I find the common ancestor them.

174
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.690
To be

175
00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.640
So dynamic I'm interested in you.

176
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.050
Right. So, it is like you find the nearest common ancestor.

177
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.710
Louis, or you can see the LC the lowest common ancestor.

178
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.940
For both of them.

179
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.110
Are all the services. He is a member of find the NCAA

180
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:23.220
Hmm. And if that NCAA is at level three and above. Perfect. If it is level at level two.

181
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.910
Then you just find the Level Two Spirit simple

182
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.610
Us, find the LLC.

183
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:41.550
Met. And if needed. Travers up until you find the level three or above node basically a level three. You know, before that. Anyways, it was above you would have anyways just chosen it and you're good with it.

184
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.130
Got the point

185
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:44.850
Yeah.

186
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.680
So simple.

187
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.390
All

188
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.360
The SEO all these all from the membership membership. Yes.

189
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.010
Yeah.

190
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.930
You know, has to be a minimum level three and you can write that. Okay.

191
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:35.280
Okay.

192
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.870
So when you do this, you have to be smart.

193
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.100
Okay.

194
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.930
You have to start from the top.

195
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.370
And

196
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:53.820
You find any membership you ignore the rest of the sub tree. Correct. You don't have to browse through the entire sub tree lesson. Remember that let's

197
00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:10.320
Manager founded an intimate cloud automation. You don't have to see anything below our division that says one membership, I bought and then I see any other thing he has no none simple automation is this group because there's already a level three group and we're good. Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:24.060
That but for people like me. Okay, I am owner of so but I have contributed to instance analyzer you find my common group which is shared services, but it is able to group so

199
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.970
I will show you cloud automation, because that is the closest level three group from shared services.

200
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.320
OK. OK.

201
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:39.240
Now the third thing I want to filter the groups also. So there are two things right first find the root group, we found the root group.

202
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:49.020
Filter the groups. I want to show automatically based on your membership against if you are have server and instance analyzer.

203
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.880
Okay, good group is cloud automation. But you see only shared services inside it.

204
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.260
Okay.

205
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.610
You don't see

206
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.750
Anything else like instance animations or

207
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:09.030
Anything else we don't see that we don't see instance automation, for example, or a sequel. We don't see that. Yes.

208
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.740
Because they are showing under

209
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:11.880
Yeah, because

210
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.480
Yeah, I have that I have a member of belong to shared services. So that's the next setting. So remember,

211
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:30.030
Any to settings in the Health Dashboard. The route group and the second level group filter for the selector selector for the second level groups inside that

212
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.760
So this extends own here and don't shoot services.

213
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:44.130
So if I'm in any way related to supine instance on resurrection. Also look at CCF and other things also.

214
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.050
Yes, yes, yes, we are not right now. I'm saying we are not filtering.

215
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.120
Because that's the good to have feature, but I don't want to do that right now.

216
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:03.930
Right, so I get your point. Well, let's not go too much. So we are trying to find what can be done in a minimum and still make sense to people.

217
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.820
But we can definitely do that in the future, but it will be too much.

218
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:21.150
Because see whatever you are giving in default tomorrow you have decks. We are also exposing the same amount of selection to the user manually.

219
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.220
Just give me a second here. I need to use these windows.

220
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.700
So,

221
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.350
What do you think

222
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.900
So I have, I have a question. Maybe I just thinking

223
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:25.650
So from the level three groups which we see. So it's like we show level three group and again filter this filter the group level two groups.

224
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.400
Right.

225
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:41.910
Why do we want. So we will only show him the level to group, right, then why do you want to go to level three and again filter some stuff, if at all, he's, you know, if at all, he is part of multiple Level two groups, fine.

226
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:52.920
Okay, so let me try to say, is your question, that why can only be a level three group or route group.

227
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:54.990
Is that

228
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.800
There could be a scenario where Level two could also be the road group.

229
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:03.570
Perfect. Very nice. So, you will have to build a new UI that is the only problem.

230
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.650
Because for now. Right now our UI is that in the Health dashboard.

231
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.500
Your widget each widget inside the health food is a group. Okay.

232
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.400
Okay. Understood.

233
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:26.910
I am trying to stick to words there now and do what's the best thing so that we don't have too much effort. Are we doing, we can do that later.

234
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:41.100
And it is easy right there is nothing that we are doing right now that will make it rigid, which, as it is now, plus something that is tomorrow, you want to make you make the UI there, you can make Level two groups as then you just do that and use enhance

235
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.450
On the photos from

236
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.930
Recorded right so there is nothing stopping us or what we're doing right now is not making it rigid

237
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.730
It is just trying to not have too much effort. Before we roll this out.

238
00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:05.730
And since we have to deliver into three. I'm trying to think, something that is very doable and there's not a change in the UI and the behavior of system and too much testing.

239
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.820
That is leaking.

240
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.710
And this thing already happens right now.

241
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:31.950
In the personalized view that we have, we automatically. That's what we do already that we filter out only the groups that you are a member of

242
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:48.240
Yes, right. Personalized you so you have to see how to integrate with that and provide an option of a drop down rather than just a toggle button is what we thought right that we don't have a toggle between non default and personalized us but a drop down

243
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.050
For you.

244
00:22:49.950 --> 00:23:05.010
And an option to save the view wherever he edits the view he can save as a new view and we just asked him a name. Now you got to think how to expose that saving the view and that I'll leave you guys, I will not get too much involved there. Right.

245
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.950
Now,

246
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.350
Know about what we should do. So yeah, let's. So this is, I think,

247
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:22.680
A complete one version one picture like where we can deliver this and we can easily go live into QA ops and they can manage

248
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.150
Their own

249
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.330
Noms. Another question, huh, okay.

250
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:36.060
Actually, so yeah. Now, let's see. The question is how much of it is necessary and how much is good to have

251
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.690
Yeah, right. That's the question I think everybody's asking you.

252
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:40.950
Know,

253
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.710
Why do we needed right now. Right. Yeah.

254
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.130
Yeah, my tsunami and I've thought right now is okay.

255
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.070
I have two independent trees in the forest. One is there. Sorry organization.

256
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.490
Is my cleanse organization. Okay.

257
00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.870
Now I have a person who's interested in viewing both

258
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.970
Huh. Okay.

259
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.780
Yeah, it is not possible without the concept of views.

260
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.240
Okay.

261
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.760
Because we have a single dashboard. Number one,

262
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:19.680
We cannot create a dynamic navigator link every day. Sometime creates a new org

263
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:28.290
Or a new and we don't know where the, where the org starts and where it does not. We can find the roots, but we are not interested in doing that.

264
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:42.330
So the only way to support that is us where he can make multiple views and he comes to the health equity might be seeing the service level engineering view servicing unit and then you can switch it to the SI view and he starts seeing a sorry

265
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:47.010
So we only have a single navigator thing which says Health Dashboard now.

266
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.080
Right, yeah. And it has different views that you can use.

267
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:58.680
So that is my views is necessary or views as needed for generalization.

268
00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.550
Okay.

269
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:07.560
Right, even in New York's for example they choose not to make any route to your ops group.

270
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:18.600
Okay, the two different teams like let's say one is Brian Scott team and other is, I mean, the hair his team other is here pernicious prestigious team.

271
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.970
They just have three independent roots.

272
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.680
Corrupt right and they are people who might want to see each other's

273
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:32.340
For example, Matt, George. He might want to see to us sometimes Nicholas reach us even sometimes his view.

274
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.240
So,

275
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.050
That's what I'm saying.

276
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:43.800
That's the whole point that he can choose any route group at any point and have multiple views.

277
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.300
And

278
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.690
Here, I think it is not an option.

279
00:25:49.980 --> 00:26:01.740
If you want to generalize a we have to have this we can make it work. Okay. You can work only with the route to us. You can choose this but again we're trying to

280
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:10.110
It's an intuitive. If you don't give this. So yeah, that's my understanding of why we need us at least

281
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:22.200
And when we are giving us okay filtering is an option whether you want to filter Level two groups or not is an option, but that might be too much noise to see everything all the time.

282
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:35.490
And it's not tough for us. It's not adding any development bandwidth from our side. We just have to be have done everything, are you, I understand how to filter groups, if they are not available in the widget.

283
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.590
Okay, right.

284
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:38.340
Understand

285
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.840
To be a great week you're

286
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.040
Here, nothing.

287
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:55.800
Soaking already have done that, we have the personalized view of coding done feature done. We just have to leverage or add some drop down and some server side tables to store user preferences and use

288
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.700
Hmm.

289
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.260
And we are done.

290
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:12.030
You did not change anything on the client. Only thing that needs to change is the query based on the server. And once the visitors that come from the server are limited you I automatically shows limited

291
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:20.610
Right. So all you need to do is have a drop down any clicks on the view, we just have a function which says get

292
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:30.360
Dashboard with the view name passed on the server side you filter based on The View, find the widgets that he wants to see all the groups that he wants to see

293
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:38.790
And return which we are already doing right now based on some automated filtering. You have to just do it based on the query on your view table.

294
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.990
Okay.

295
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.010
Right. Yes. Yeah.

296
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:50.850
Nothing. Can we just discussed before. What do you define as a view that you're seeing

297
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.660
Any view is a route group.

298
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.970
What is the

299
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:04.200
For that service off of that dashboard anything level three and above you only allow a level three and above route groups.

300
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:15.450
And filter Level two groups that you want to see without inside to a true group. And by default, you see everything. But you can remove some level two groups or yeah you can just edit that list to see

301
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.640
Two things inside of you.

302
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.290
And this building this

303
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.810
Particular user and the group's list.

304
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.320
Will I will not discuss the table schema design.

305
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.580
Let's not get into how you do whether do you do as a Related lists or list. I will leave that decision to you.

306
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.670
Or it is certain that is too granular

307
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:45.750
But that's the view for me right now. That would group and level two groups inside that route.

308
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:47.610
Okay.

309
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.570
And as creating a by default personalized view.

310
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.720
Which changes.

311
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.530
You know, anytime basically

312
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.060
By default to Allah.

313
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:20.160
Can we do it at the I was thinking, okay, my by default. Voila. As soon as the user lands, we don't find any view for him. So the creation default view create the default view and rendering them. That's what we need to do. I think that's a

314
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.720
Good question. I think there are two approaches. One is

315
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.150
Crazy. We can do that, what

316
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.320
You are saying lazy, lazy is only once, right, what happens

317
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.410
When later his membership changes.

318
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:46.140
Are you going to update that record of the default view all you're never going to show any default, but always build it on the fly.

319
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:52.200
They're not on our list, building on what options are there, but I think the ablation one if any change.

320
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.340
Again, I need to

321
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.120
Add years to find like if anyone

322
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.960
Find all the people who are related.

323
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.650
To on the flavors. Gotta

324
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:17.370
Know, so I get your point. The only issue. There is no other issue in updating and maintaining a record, other than

325
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.820
Moving update sets from dev to floor.

326
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:29.610
How do I because when you move updates in depth to death to prod if any membership changes. I cannot run business rules.

327
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:38.820
Because business rules don't trigger otherwise updating when group membership changes is the right thing to do. I feel

328
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.250
How did the member update the view default view when the membership changes accordingly.

329
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:50.460
Every membership changes the record, you see the corresponding things that need to change. And always keep it in sync.

330
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.700
Right, that's one way and your default view happens and that is okay. No big deal.

331
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.080
But the only issue with that is it does not happen.

332
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.840
When things move from death to product.

333
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.520
Yes.

334
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.740
Right, because then it's addition.

335
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.670
Use Kevin you to capture the views, I think, but different memberships can be their independence, Kansas. Yeah.

336
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.000
Not

337
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:27.510
The whole issue of movement weeks at up till now. I think all our issues are based on updates for men. That's where all the entire mess happens and this, this, this is no exception. So

338
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:38.970
And that is only why I'm saying that there's the only reason why I feel on the fly. If we can write a good algorithm which is not does cause we will traverse from the root.

339
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.800
And

340
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:53.190
See what our route things. He is so do a bfs top to bottom okay to be Fs and see find his group membership. Wherever you find you just you just stop the bfs for that regression

341
00:31:54.270 --> 00:32:06.510
So don't go and don't explore or don't add further children of that node wherever you found this membership to the Q. Basically, if not repression, let's just talk about a few based implementation. Right.

342
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.440
But what we feel part of multiple arcs which part of the

343
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.960
PFS right BFS will be

344
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.590
All the

345
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.600
Forest.

346
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.150
So first, add the root nodes. First of all the trees inside

347
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:35.370
Then automatically BFS will follow for first right rather than just adding the root of one tree, you had the roots of all trees and then do a simple BFS test and consider this was the first level nodes or four of the router a virtual router.

348
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.390
Correct, correct.

349
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:44.460
So, and that's it whenever you find something you just skip you just don't add the children of that note to the queue.

350
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:48.900
Right.

351
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:50.670
So,

352
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.930
You know, have

353
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:57.690
A class also to handle all this logic. So that's the place. It has to be correct.

354
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:08.790
Correct. So just one more thing. Then when we are doing these things on the fly. The only option. He can change in the UI is the group not he cannot select the View.

355
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.560
Just give me a second. I have a stand up at 1045

356
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.300
I didn't get your point of anger. Can you repeat

357
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:31.260
So first of all, we are we are not saving the one way, one way where we are not saving the default view and we are generating a dinner on the fly, right.

358
00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:33.330
Okay.

359
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:34.680
Now,

360
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.000
If he is only selecting the other the other option we thought of is where he can save his views.

361
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:43.860
Yeah, he can save as use. Yes.

362
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.330
He can save his views.

363
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:58.950
Instead of saving his views, then he can filter the when you just thinking again if he if he just filter the groups in the dashboard and this do the same logic for the bad group.

364
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:13.770
See, it's not a problem. He can filter. If you allow him, but he has to have the option to save it as a few just like your queries you can query on the fly like also save the various filters that you can choose later.

365
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:23.700
Okay. Okay, I gotta leave right now I have a stand up. I joined back at 11 if you guys are there for

366
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.620
You guys joined back in

367
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.480
Shallow. Okay.

368
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:37.950
We're

369
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.870
Recording

370
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.260
To do you see if the last one right you see

371
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:48.450
I just paused it so it is

372
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.670
Because the stock, you're going to deposit

373
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:51.990
All you gotta do.

374
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.270
Hello. I hope it continues to get okay can

375
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.650
I can challenge. Okay, so, so

376
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:06.900
A lot of what we were discussing was how so like from the users perspective, he starts navigating from the first step.

377
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:16.530
What are the possible scenarios. I'll just give you know in two minutes, I'll just talk on how the user navigation happens and what is what is what we could

378
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:22.440
Which steps, who at what steps, what things we need to save and resume when he comes back or

379
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:28.770
Re render when he comes back to that page. So let's say I'm the user for the first time. I'm hoping the Health dashboard.

380
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:38.160
So there comes a scenario where am part of either one or the other part of multiple or meaning. I have to her related roles in different arcs or multiple single or

381
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:50.550
Imagine the cases. First one is, I have. I am a part of a single org and I have some some role. Let's say I'm a contact. We are contributed for one of the group. Let's say it is a table group level two.

382
00:35:51.720 --> 00:36:08.400
Now, since I am a part of the particular org I select the org for him. And I also find the least possible common or LCA group and then about level two and show him the default here there is no issue. Okay, till here. Are you on me along with me.

383
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:19.380
Yeah. Oh, so now what happens, till now. There was nothing saved in the back end. And now what the thing is, as who have implemented. So let's say for him that user.

384
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:25.710
These preferences you so user comma that are good karma and the group.

385
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:38.340
Which he has viewed the different below services has so that is currently his preference and imagine he keeps coming to this as the dashboard and nothing's nothing. He is to say, changing on the

386
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:48.720
Group dashboard, we will simply get that from the org from disabled by default view or whatever and show him imagine he wants to change.

387
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:55.410
No, no. So wait, yeah. Are you saving the out of the box personalized view or is it on the fly.

388
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:03.240
I'm saying that's what I'm doing. I'm saving the view. Let's call it a view. So what the view. I'm saying is, like, let's say, the user the are

389
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.830
You saving with

390
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:05.490
The

391
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.520
Options both options we have

392
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:16.080
Dynamic difficulty without rate which is not saved, anywhere, and it's always the default is always figured out on the fly.

393
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:24.330
Yeah, hard truth. That's what so two options. Again, they are. So what happens in both scenarios. Imagine I say okay scenario one. Okay.

394
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.930
So we're not saving right now, just go with one

395
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.890
Then it's confused.

396
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.840
Okay, will not save. Okay.

397
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:36.030
Yeah, it seemed as if, now he's just seeing the out of the box view which we fed on the fly, say,

398
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.140
No. Okay.

399
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:54.690
Good. Now every time he comes every time we dynamically calculate is the org and the group and show him imagine in the dashboard. He wants to see, not for the LCA group that gave me gave but probably anything below that in one of the

400
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.440
Anything specific or just below that particularly LCA group, let's say,

401
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:11.820
Then I need to at least in this scenario, I need to remember that. Whoa, this guy is now the last viewed thing is this particular or groups.

402
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:17.760
View, so I need to save that at least what the next steps for the next time.

403
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.950
remembering stuff.

404
00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:21.480
No wait, again,

405
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:23.280
Okay.

406
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.630
Please come into this. So NCAA the camera.

407
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:40.350
And he says, Okay, no, I don't know LCA, you have the option to change the group that you all see the group. So I changed the group that I want to see LLC in a future needs your coach or rescinded.

408
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:48.780
That corresponds to as a view he has changed, other than the different you know corresponds to is a view.

409
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.100
That particular

410
00:38:51.450 --> 00:39:02.760
If he that he explicitly says please save this use that next time and they come here, they kind of are we always kind of save money. Nobody changes that

411
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.970
Is your thing, you will save the last view.

412
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.600
Which is not saving the view stable, but in some other settings some other place, which we

413
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.870
Owned by default. Again, that's the decision. You gotta take what

414
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.110
What are

415
00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.890
We setting. It is not saving explicitly. How are we saving it.

416
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:28.590
On

417
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:30.180
Yeah.

418
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.850
For us, it's a view it's exactly a view.

419
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.880
If he if he selects a particular

420
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.530
View overview table mean over and talking about a view not

421
00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:42.930
Okay.

422
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.620
This whole

423
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.310
Body user last you available for everyone, which

424
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:47.790
We

425
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.080
All have years

426
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.070
It might. It was

427
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.640
Yeah and we keep changing that based on aesthetics

428
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.140
Yeah.

429
00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:05.640
See if it fits in his other book. Let's say will change that setting. So, and only one recording maintained for that user for that Oregon, but that only user plus or only one record is meant it.

430
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.460
Means, so for for a user and for an org, you will always see what

431
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.730
For a user info. There's only per user view.

432
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:18.390
Last few

433
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:27.030
So, so then, okay, fine. That will Safari per user like the that are per user. It is only one view that

434
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.210
contains both the organic groups inside

435
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.910
Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Okay, fine now.

436
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:40.980
Imagine in the same way if it changes the if he changes the org in the view dashboard. Let's say the same happens

437
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:49.200
You can select the either the group or wheels on select of the change of the org will show him the least possible LLC, a group

438
00:40:49.530 --> 00:41:01.710
And renders and if he wants to select change the group, we can he can change. So this is the behavior. Now, coming to the second point where he wants to explicitly save different views. OK.

439
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:03.630
OK.

440
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.370
Till here we are on the same page, but

441
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.220
Let's, let's go ahead and got what you're saying.

442
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.020
So now if you want to save explicit views. Yeah.

443
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:28.290
So if the first of all, thinking about with us. How many filters we will have will be having in the UI elements. Either he selects are organic group combination or explicitly the view that is option, he should, we should have right that so we should be able to see

444
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.740
Yeah, I get your point.

445
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.780
So now.

446
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:47.820
Is so what is now I was when we are they thinking I was thinking like what, what if we miss. I'm just trying to compare between the order plus group versus the view.

447
00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.260
All plus group is of you.

448
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.160
Know,

449
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.410
Are hopeless foreign countries have you, yes.

450
00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:07.380
organs are all the plus group is concerned, we are entering the view. And then we are comparing. That means what is the advantage of saving the additional view if we if

451
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.150
We given to us as

452
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:22.830
Water is coming to us. So up until now. We'll discuss it will change character that is the view that you see what is unfair advantage if he give an option to save money made many more reviews for him.

453
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:36.990
Like he students and our Oregon other group. And he says, Okay, this is also a different view. I want. Should we, should you escape a co curricular. This is a different are we giving a visit. Go to give that out.

454
00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:43.920
Your views should be. They're always so see you Saturday. Simple as that. Don't kitchen table today.

455
00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.470
Is the last of it'll add the herbivore, the class what you're doing, without the

456
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:52.830
Views without the views. What you are doing is that

457
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.100
Correct, correct.

458
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.800
The filters.

459
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:07.740
There, where he has to he wants to have different views like okay I have a view of SRT, and I have a view of cloud automation specific and I

460
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:14.970
Have a view of shared services or service engineering, for example, so I might have to like

461
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:28.230
Let's say, Mike, you said yes. He saves for views for himself. Mike says one view because every time he doesn't want to filter what he needs right because

462
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:42.630
Yeah, so, because he tried to save and listing record YOU'RE SAVING ONLY one view by user by default. RIGHT. YOU'RE SAVING ONLY one new per user. By default, you can not saving all the possible combinations that he has

463
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.870
Made

464
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.680
Yeah, it's only one or two me or what

465
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.290
Yeah, you keep overriding that view right

466
00:43:50.040 --> 00:44:00.720
That is it. So now the question comes, when we are saving the multiple views for that user when he saves. So how do we invalidate that view when the membership of the user changes first point.

467
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.960
You don't have to invalidate anything if he wants to see

468
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.000
Something. Exactly. We don't have validate

469
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:18.780
If he wants to see something he can only see if he has a viewer role to it. First of all, we don't even though he says that I want to see 10 groups, but tomorrow is your role is going to be anyways filter that

470
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.100
Through

471
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:20.730
His he has

472
00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:23.640
To have at least a viewer role for a group to see it.

473
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:41.160
So my argument against this extra views would be so as we said abuse go a organization and a group. So when he talks between the group. It's exactly he is just taking

474
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.910
The lead like manager and he comes and he respects the group that he wants the leaf node.

475
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:54.870
So why should we save this as a separate view when he can just click the chat and select the

476
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.990
Who ceilings separately.

477
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.960
Lucy is this views only just for the quick toggle

478
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.270
I didn't get it.

479
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.760
Hey, we're talking about a bullet and I he needs to have

480
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:18.750
Multiple use for if he concentrates on or do you say instance automation. Yeah, that is a separate to view that he can see

481
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.110
If you consented Saunders. That is afraid to

482
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:22.800
Say,

483
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:28.770
So that as we said the view conscious of just him selecting a global

484
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.230
Group, right, excellent filter of the groups.

485
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:37.710
Yeah, so that that's the point I should be your filters. This is what I'm saying.

486
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:45.840
Is a fit. So this is Sweden is a good to have, but we give giving filters for now is what my question.

487
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.850
Filter for what again, I must

488
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.290
Change with the

489
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.390
Time box. Okay, let me get to

490
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.300
Understand is your vision around the dynamic thing versus the same you thing.

491
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:09.870
Is that us you know I'm talking about the filter. Once you set up a group and you have a soft filter saying that scan their case after him a key brands because, oh, is that correct, right.

492
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:11.610
Yeah.

493
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:19.050
That thing are we going to implement rational. Is it okay. Do we have the amount of

494
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:26.610
Time to do this, how, why is it tough. So it's simple as that. You have to provide the cross button at the top of each

495
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.790
Other things. Let's see.

496
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:36.120
Here, an option to save this as a view Kochi whatever is the current save it as a view.

497
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.320
Yeah, so my fingers.

498
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.140
For we know need to invest a

499
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:54.000
substantial amount into developing this particular UI for this election of this group or and application of this filter.

500
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:55.890
Right.

501
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.460
If you don't have a data we can test.

502
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.780
If he doesn't have a filter. What can you do

503
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:22.440
Know if he doesn't have reverted I understand that it limits the amount of control that have any particular view, what I'm saying is we are going to in, we need to invest it I'm just asking, Is it okay that we invest this this amount of

504
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.680
Time in developing this particular you wait for him to select and

505
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:40.920
Why is it that amount of time. What is that amount of time. You're talking about how much time do you think it's going to take. So let's talk about that. And first of all, it's not the discussion about this question is not about prioritization. I will leave that to you and carlyon right

506
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:47.100
Yeah, just talking about, so you didn't know how to cut out of scope. I'll leave the decision to come on and when

507
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:53.910
you're discussing what's needed. Now, where to carve out the scope, I'll give you guys full freedom.

508
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:55.230
Okay.

509
00:47:55.620 --> 00:48:02.460
Yeah. So let's, I don't want to get into discussing that, because no longer my domain to decide what we want to do when

510
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:07.320
Okay, hey, this is a full picture, you can have what you want to do when

511
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.180
Tax is called based on the other. Our Q4 deliverables time we have 123 of how much we have to deliver and

512
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.670
What are the timelines. If we do this.

513
00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.260
We will do that right

514
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:27.660
Okay, let's just discuss what we want to achieve completely and then how much you will when that's not get there.

515
00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:32.880
Okay, so it's a quarter. That's it. Okay, cool.

516
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.680
Let's discuss it. There is a gap in understanding the whole picture.

517
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.600
And it was wrong with it.

518
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:45.360
So, so are you up to what we said no.

519
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.410
Organization that he says, and

520
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:57.570
Group Selection three that he selects his group and apply a filter on and also an option to save his shoes. Yes.

521
00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:04.260
Save his view or I don't know if you are a giver. Create a view where you have a forum where you can sell sector.

522
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.500
Model pop up when you say create a view so that you

523
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.660
Save this as a view.

524
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:17.400
Based on what is the current view because he has filtered using your dynamic that throws to filter the widgets and change the route group.

525
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:27.150
Or from the dashboard and you can see this is a directory where you just, again, a pop up that phone by default populate the settings, ask him to feed us the name of that view.

526
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:38.370
You just create a proper create a new form and you just need the name because everything is populated, or if you can say create new we can just populate everything

527
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.490
Fine, is that, yeah.

528
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.780
So yeah, I have one one.

529
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:56.700
Simply we give him the

530
00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:58.770
Name of

531
00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:00.330
The story.

532
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.340
I was thinking, just as well.

533
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:03.750
So,

534
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:14.280
There is like simple like create a view where he would give the name of the view then followed by that particular organ group and what are the filters. He wants to apply. It's completely together one form, let's say,

535
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:20.820
And he saves that and on the dashboard. He comes and just only select that particular name of view and we keep

536
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:25.080
Showing, what are the view related stuff.

537
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:26.730
Is

538
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.570
Easy to do through it but not user friendly.

539
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.920
Ok ok ok

540
00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.750
What is lack of ds.

541
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:44.370
You implement yes but not a user friendly approach in the sense where he wants to do dynamic filtering just, I would say, take your query filters as your reference

542
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:45.210
Okay.

543
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.230
All you're giving extra is the current

544
00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.420
As an option.

545
00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.250
Yeah yeah

546
00:50:54.420 --> 00:51:03.690
That's the only extra thing otherwise everything else remains the same, just, well, that will differ is the UI or the way we are exposing the options that

547
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:12.120
Are now available now we things are clear it. One is to create to explicitly create the view option. The other one is to save the existing a filter option.

548
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:22.410
The third one other option. Another is to fill out, select the same review to render to view the dashboard and the extra option is know how the dynamic

549
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:28.890
Filtering he applies from the view, I need to little thing. Yeah, so

550
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:34.140
Other thing I'm which I want you guys to think is, do you want to see it. The last view.

551
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:39.240
Or view only in the last few if you explicitly saves it

552
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:48.870
So every time he comes generally people have come see me, I'm looking at who has things. So I'm most likely I would only see one of the things most likely I would

553
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:57.450
Island. I was interested in seeing the same thing and I hardly change, I can change, but it's very less that I chains of things and see the same thing.

554
00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.060
I am seeing if that is the case.

555
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.140
You should all talk

556
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.770
To other groups. Why the fuck you have ownership to other groups.

557
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:18.600
Getting my point, right. See you, if that is the case, the user has all set himself as a viewer and contribute or 200 things which he does not actually which is not right and that is why you see interview which he needs to filter.

558
00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:34.620
Every time. Right. Why are we taking that pain of saving his last year, although he didn't want to if he was if it was important for him, he would have saved it as a few to to come next time and say, okay, said this is my default view.

559
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:49.710
We can save the last to view he saw not the last settings, but the last view. So let's say he saved it as are my view and okay we save the setting. Okay. His last review was my view.

560
00:52:52.410 --> 00:53:02.670
Rather than be saving the settings of this view in the last few names like we've ourself, create a custom view for VR create a custom view for already. That is the personalized view.

561
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:09.240
And always default to it if he does not have any other view that he saw the last time.

562
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.810
Okay.

563
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:20.940
So option is either. So our settings would be every time a user comes, we have to see what was the last few years, so

564
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:26.040
That either it is the personalized view or the other.

565
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.090
Later someone

566
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.610
Over there, whatever.

567
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:30.210
Yes, yes.

568
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:39.000
He's just load that in. And if he changes. Anybody settings. We don't save that until he sees it as a different view.

569
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:52.620
You might give them an option to edit views. Okay, I saved it as my view, but now I want to edit my view, and I want to change the settings of my view.

570
00:53:55.020 --> 00:54:13.380
Okay, so they should have an option to update my view or save this setting as a new view both things. He just said, Okay, I made some changes and my original my based view was my view that I was seeing. And then I made some changes to that. And I want to update my view with these changes.

571
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.000
Okay, okay, or I want to create a new view my view to

572
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:27.750
That's something you should think about. And whenever he is my view to his last few would become my view to next time he comes, he will see my view to

573
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.800
I think, you know, receiving and view based on his last settings which

574
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.700
Save.

575
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:37.140
Is an overkill.

576
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:47.400
Because you would like him to change something is very frequent that he has always to do them by is your membership reflecting differently.

577
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.010
You would want him to

578
00:54:53.340 --> 00:55:02.940
Acquire not a service. Both are points, but it's like we cannot assistance is even the current he can correct that stuff. But if he doesn't collect them. We need to handle that as well.

579
00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:10.050
Yeah, so he can always say is you I'm somebody who does enforcement, which are you that product.

580
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:13.830
What is what so what direction we need to go instead of the

581
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.780
Day. They make some spreadsheet stuff. But what direction we take. Is that right, that we need to think

582
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:24.000
So I think for fighting you should not say the last viewed settings.

583
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.270
Okay, so the last two things.

584
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:36.690
Are a the last few ticks or the views that he has these are two different things. And both Quinn Quinn coexisted ones.

585
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:46.650
Yeah, so I am saying do the last view thing rather last few settings saving I just say that. So if it's that important let him save it as a view.

586
00:55:47.610 --> 00:56:03.750
Of how I feel. The more the variables, the more confusing the product becomes yes, you know, so let's keep that we already have us and he understands that he says something is us. And every time he comes back. He sees the last to view a change to

587
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:14.070
So all the three different all all a number of instances, but the same user and same dashboard would have might have different views. We don't capture the news and updates. That's right.

588
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.870
I get to a point.

589
00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.450
To start with, I think,

590
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.410
VPN.

591
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:31.380
Really can if you want to like recap. But the problem is the same. I'm telling you now the group membership can different different

592
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:41.400
Instances. So let's like so I'll, I'll not save the view all at once. I'm going to Disney parks a wants to say one save the view, what is the, what is about them for the first time, only we are letting you say right

593
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.000
Okay, so I think one thing we didn't discuss

594
00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.380
Which we discussed last time is about when he

595
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:15.300
Are we trying to limit. I think about maybe I will try and limit on what he can do based on his current membership, for example, although he is not a viewer of some groups.

596
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:20.070
Do we show him like seven cloud automation was that it is this route group.

597
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:26.340
Okay cloud vision was settings and that's all the setting, he has done.

598
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:34.290
He didn't filter out any groups to we show him groups inside them where he does not have any viewer chip.

599
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:40.740
I think that I ended. I will be shown to him with the current logic or with the current thinking I have whatever the thinking

600
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.000
Because right now, what we're saying is there's a view.

601
00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:54.000
I'm inside the root and filter out because we are not saying you limit you are based on the current roles on what you can see

602
00:57:54.990 --> 00:58:04.320
Oh, that's so I come to tell board and I'm inside. So the. Now let's say that are using something like I'm not part of any other groups. I don't have any access but I

603
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:17.160
Opened the history, Albert and even the during that time, there is no view saved it also from the dynamic view. I couldn't find anything that is suitable for that day. Why should win as of now I in my mind was like, okay, he doesn't see anything.

604
00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:19.500
Who

605
00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:30.690
Do you guys want something to be seen. But what, how does it make sense for him. He doesn't try to go and create a new with right rules. If you have get the rules get the host and create a view and come and see that

606
00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.100
There is no roles. So that's where see there is a problem is so like right now.

607
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.210
There is no authority that gives you roles as to why they are self assignable

608
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:41.310
Right.

609
00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.290
You can assign them to yourselves.

610
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:45.390
So,

611
00:58:46.590 --> 00:59:00.450
Are the one way is like you want to edit group membership for yourself, right, like the way we do in personalized dashboard edit group membership. You can edit your group membership and automatically your personalized view will change.

612
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.720
Because you said you are a viewer to so and so.

613
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:11.490
Right, so I get your point. So, there should be a way by which he can edit group membership.

614
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.940
So,

615
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:31.770
The because right now. He comes he sees nothing in that click on this icon at the audit purposes. Right.

616
00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:37.710
So yeah, just give me a second.

617
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:57.000
Yeah, let's get back. So to get there should be a video editor membership, which is already there, actually.

618
00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:58.410
And

619
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:07.170
Maybe we can later not not think about more intuitive ways to for him to edit the group membership.

620
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:15.000
Membership if you want to restrict team, getting the membership or somebody else. Some authenticated user only using. So that's a different story.

621
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.620
Right now.

622
01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:21.330
You will have to add this thing, which is not in the current scope of things is

623
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.830
Not show him the groups to which she does not have a role.

624
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:35.220
Right, like querying for a user, you always have to filter only those records which he has a role to

625
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:37.920
You know,

626
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:45.810
Hey user generated membership to the Revolutionary War visa have this already there.

627
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.280
Has

628
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:52.440
Been added or from the dashboard. You can add it is membership that's there.

629
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.810
I'm reading this is there, what

630
01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:04.830
Yeah, but you gotta see you got to add the back end logic to filter out widgets or groups which he does not have any role to while rendering

631
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:11.070
So there is nothing like a default view. No.

632
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:18.690
No default when you click on default, you see all the groups for the entire or

633
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.460
Um,

634
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.380
We have to take that away.

635
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:24.090
Okay.

636
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.630
Yeah, because we don't know which all he wants to see

637
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.830
Yes.

638
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.300
In this general version, you don't know which all he wants to see

639
01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:35.730
Okay.

640
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.050
So we will completely get away with that.

641
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.420
Before

642
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:58.560
But it has to be decided. I will let you take the delinquency. I'll tell you the purpose that default view was introduced, okay, I can tell you the thought process and need it was

643
01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.820
Bad Casey said, Show me so

644
01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.700
Current and give me the access to so

645
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.040
We gave him so

646
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:14.310
But when he went there, he saw nothing is visible. Now if you don't expect somebody like Pat. CASEY Who do

647
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:15.750
Not have membership.

648
01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:17.430
Right.

649
01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:25.260
I'm reading group membership and that is why we always have a default view that okay if somebody has a role or we show them everything

650
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:26.880
I'm currently

651
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:28.500
Right. And you can always filter.

652
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:30.480
Yeah.

653
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:35.970
So there are two ways when somebody has no show him everything or show him nothing

654
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:45.870
On this by default if some if he doesn't be by we couldn't find any view for me directly taken to default view for now. And let's see how the complaints from

655
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:49.830
Yeah, there were no complaints people complain about having access

656
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.460
And interact

657
01:02:50.580 --> 01:03:01.830
People always complain about having no access. So the only problem now will be which are which are when you show. Let's say there are multiple or service engineering

658
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:11.790
And sorry if somebody comes with no rule anything, which are you going to show him. Now, earlier we had only one so we could just show service engineering and everything.

659
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.850
But now there are multiple so he then he has to have an option to select

660
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.580
The default org

661
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:34.260
On that he wants to see, and then we show them everything for the tall or the by default. Select and all called service engineering and everything is and you can always change from service engineering to sorry. Yeah.

662
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.850
So I think I like the idea of show everything

663
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.010
Because right now. Anyways, the rules are self assignment.

664
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:51.780
Um, so yeah not restrictive. So then we should have it. And that is, NOBODY COMPLAINS

665
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.500
And if so, let's say, yeah.

666
01:03:57.450 --> 01:04:00.270
And so everything if the user has no members.

667
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.620
Have no membership is trying

668
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:03.660
To

669
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.230
Just make it the second point of G, rather than edge.

670
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:16.440
And you don't try default we just say, let it be to everything. You know, just to everything you can say

671
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.760
Show everything just say, well,

672
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:22.920
Okay.

673
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.780
Let's do everything we

674
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.500
Have to decide on the or for which you want to show everything

675
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.210
Then

676
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.310
That's it. This is not a decision. Show show everything. So everything completed Roberta visible.

677
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:36.210
Yeah yeah

678
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.340
I think that is the right thing for somebody seeing the thing is more painful.

679
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.700
So other question I have. Now I need to think about

680
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:53.040
But yeah, the thing is that he does not have any personalized view that is the only God sees you know

681
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:57.420
So I need to think is then little bit about

682
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:02.610
The dashboard config for the service level dashboards, then

683
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:05.580
If there are multiple orcs.

684
01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:07.170
Yeah, come again.

685
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.990
But the service level dashboard. Yeah.

686
01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:13.860
You just change the name of service nearing help to help. That's it.

687
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.210
And this little dashboard. We have a meeting.

688
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:27.900
We that service that Albert conflict is there for a particular service particular service group and the service delivery service level dashboard and the matrix.

689
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:35.040
Which group that I think no no we don't we don't need access it is

690
01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:38.730
All you need to do is change the name of service engineering health data.

691
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:41.370
That is the very first point.

692
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.420
Yeah, yeah, I think.

693
01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.130
Stand up. Okay.

694
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:51.630
Yeah, done.

695
01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.010
Mostly on

696
01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:01.650
alomar you can skip that for today. Man, that is, like, I need to study. Well, whatever you have done to

697
01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.260
Stand out from today, yesterday morning. I'm totally talking

698
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.760
Yeah. Student user and you do whatever we discussed last thing.

699
01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:17.460
I think happened for mice in my spare time. It's just only talking, talking, I'm tired of talking this sprinting.

700
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.030
Okay, some rubber stamp on

701
01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.780
It and we have the points, we have the it's all about what the part we are taking. That's the

702
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:39.930
Simple. So now, now you I'll leave it to you to refine and but the basic decision is this and let's let it, let let you present to learn and thoroughness. Let's have their feedback.

703
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:47.130
But refinements. I will leave it to you. So just decide the refinements don't involve the refined things. Okay.

704
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:48.600
Yeah.

705
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.500
She just

706
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.710
Didn't give it a chance at refinement, I will leave it to

707
01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.630
Shown maybe this is fine. All you can review with me anytime notions.

708
01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:04.440
