1
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.590
Let me see if he can

2
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.620
Join at least

3
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.540
John so yeah

4
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.270
I think only gym is the pages.

5
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.050
Hey,

6
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.850
Hey. Hi. Jennifer Scalia, I joined recently as part of the cloud analytics team at the manager.

7
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:45.720
How great

8
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.730
We gave a couple of minutes to show me because I think. Yeah, give us a moment.

9
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.780
Are you in the meeting.

10
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:37.320
Okay.

11
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.870
So I

12
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.310
Hello.

13
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:49.620
She died.

14
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.930
Okay, so somebody you're on the audience.

15
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.270
Yeah, she's good.

16
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:12.150
Okay, cool. Um, so this isn't a huge thing. But let me show you what I saw share my screen.

17
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.110
Hi.

18
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.790
Can you increase the size. Yes, sorry.

19
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.550
I'm sorry, what's

20
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.970
The size of it. It's a bit small.

21
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.530
Just one sense, yeah.

22
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:55.800
So,

23
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.700
This is kind of a minor thing but it keeps happening. So I was asking me, Shannon. Bobby, if we could

24
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.140
Could do something about it. Another minute too big.

25
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.860
And anyhow. Um, what typically happens is we upgrade and then

26
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.260
I realize that the pattern thing didn't run well

27
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.050
Usually what happens is I don't realize that had anything didn't run. I go here and I look for.

28
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:36.690
For new errors. After the upgrade and I say, okay, we haven't had a new era since 710

29
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.920
So everything's fine.

30
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.420
And then

31
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:51.210
And then I realized know they must have put some new error message in the program or warning or something. So then I I'm like, oh, what I have to do. And then I I go figure out and I run the

32
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.710
Runs once a week now. Is that right, somebody

33
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.230
Yes, on justice.

34
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.780
Right on Tuesdays. So, um, I think it's about to run so

35
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.580
And I know how to kick it off if I need to. So I was just

36
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:16.620
I was just I'd forgotten why we why we do it weekly. And I was wondering if there was some

37
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.140
Way to make sure it happened after an upgrade.

38
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:43.590
So after upgrade is very like to see that. Right. So will it be okay if we give an API, which gets called by that great team after everything settles or after 24 hours of that or do we give a button, which can just all here which says get new patterns in the ideal job.

39
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:55.770
Thinking about that. Yes. Right. That but he's so busy with the upgrade. Yeah, why don't I find out for you what the best way to do that is because I'm sure there's someone here who knows, um,

40
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:03.840
Because yeah, I was like I was thinking about how would you know that an upgrade happened 24 hours ago.

41
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.720
Yeah, so

42
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.150
APA or the button and upgrading my esteem probably

43
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.230
Yeah.

44
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:22.440
If they could use that API or the button, so it'd be better if we talked to them and they learned after an upgrade.

45
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.350
Okay, yeah. Why is this team would probably be a good one to do it.

46
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:33.720
Okay, yeah, so probably will ask them whether they will like an API or a button. Right. Okay.

47
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.440
Sounds good.

48
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:46.170
So is there any preference mostly with a great team who will be annoying when the upgrade happens so they're able to trigger the API to right

49
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.130
Yeah, that makes

50
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.160
It requires the right guy we just asked him, What do you

51
00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.420
Mean by 13 they should be at next several days over the last one. The last week, they might not have been us.

52
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.850
We don't drive it from there.

53
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.590
Yeah.

54
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.050
How many new hires coming

55
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:24.330
And regarding the other one, the updated versions looks like because we are extending the application table. Yeah, we have launched a request for

56
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:37.260
So long. She was just thinking about you had asked this earlier that you would want to see that there's more frequently, rather than wait for a week. Right, right. So do we give you an EPA or

57
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.950
A patent kind of thing which you could click car called API after 24 hours of an upgrade so that there are lucky headers, which get accumulating

58
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:56.370
So, which one would you prefer. Do you want to think about it and get back. What am I would prefer in tonight, and I said, Okay, yeah. So right there.

59
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.900
Table manual that right. You can do that. You write some code that runs right after or that figures debate.

60
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:16.440
Know, giving Tony, can I can run it on demand outside. So, but if you give me a button. If I wanted to me. What I want you to understand. Is there any script that you run after uptake that you have on your side. We don't have an answer.

61
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.640
So we will say this.

62
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.610
Is

63
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.490
Immediately after that.

64
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:39.480
Yeah, because it was so nice covering up here, it has to capture the logs. Then we analyze the logs into any new so we come back to this common seeing if this is a new in here.

65
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:47.580
Or is it been opening the one point that I'm trying to say here is that even though, let's say the discoveries running but you'll get to know when the discoveries and it right

66
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:55.080
Now, let me know. So we will be faster so that love knowledge they need to come, click the button wait for some time, because we need to

67
00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:07.470
Be ready when they come to this is the place will be coming to the first occurred on you have a button there. You like that in itself 545 minute thing.

68
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.990
Because it might be

69
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:24.870
Three minutes while that happens. So, in your case, there's a trigger, which can be used to invoke it tech button. Seems like we have to go into it every time.

70
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:35.730
Yeah, that's my little bit of my concern. Like it easy for you, actually, as soon as the discovery and you will get some event right see that okay so say

71
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:44.640
We take a discord DC do an example. We have around 3040 disco schedules will be running at different times.

72
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:59.070
So each will trigger start working at its own scheduled time Michael ended a different time. So when you say it's auto trigger you have to run your job as soon as a schedule ends for each scheduled

73
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:11.670
Every be like that. And the design perspective how you are planning to do that. Like, how much is the Lord is going to fall under the center. That's one thing on introduce introduce punk. Okay, so that is the first thing. The second thing is

74
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:18.360
How you simulate the data and present the data is it like the data from the last round to present Cheyenne or

75
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.150
So if you want to do that. So, for example, the last time that you have run around.

76
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:45.330
9am what time is three and 410 am industry again. So you're going to show the one hour of gap in a different way, or is it again the candidate of all of them. It's only the car loans which will be taking but to me.

77
00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:54.840
I feel it's better that you give it at least they know all the discovery. So, you will have different pattern kind of calories. Right. You're all of them finished running and

78
00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:08.250
So then when you have different types of errors when you do the LCS that I'm taking just one type of other than that becomes the pattern. So you made for at least 24 hours and then planet, you get a better cluster is what I feel.

79
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.690
So, say that again immediately of

80
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.900
giving it some time so

81
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.760
Current processes. It is anyway triggering off 20 for us now.

82
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:30.330
It is only on Tuesdays. So what are those we if we give you the mountain manual sitting down to look at it.

83
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:44.220
In three minutes should come in. But if we give you an API probably after all the discovery said, you also have one day have finished after that probably towards the front left from Jim

84
00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:55.860
Says you will be the best person to do it. Tell us what to do because you weren't that great person if we do something we not exactly momentum great happens right so

85
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:11.010
If we give you an API or a button that trigger has to be triggered by you. What do you prefer as well. Okay, so, I mean, in my opinion, the one that I shared some time back as well. So before upgrade after upgrade or whatever the time frame.

86
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:22.290
If you give a provision to show the difference as well. The new patterns have been created posts that are the new IPs that have been discovered pose that like as a default

87
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:32.280
So that would be the ideal things instead of putting everything in a consultative manner. So especially like the trigger part what you're trying to say enough is more

88
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.590
Point A to Point B.

89
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.880
So what's the difference that happened from point A to point B. So instead of having all the bus all the past history.

90
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.560
So maybe we can have that as a, what are the new things that happened.

91
00:18:47.580 --> 00:19:04.980
Hey boss here last time. Yeah. But the last last so like so. That's not what I see is like a human accumulates all the time consolidates all of them together. So it's tough to identify like maybe put a timeline and try to do that.

92
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:17.310
We can see that. Do you want a different way to see. I think what vices suggesting is let's say you you will. And luckily the 70s late 70s back we ran

93
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:34.230
The X amount of errors they have by amount like like sort of this discussion that he wants to get a difference of what it looks like to after somewhere so that way it gives sense to a perspective of what happens like me, if, if you want to have a click as an option.

94
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:43.620
You know, otherwise, if you're trying to go with an auto inclination. So then we have to find it out by putting a query or something else. But if you're seeing click as an option.

95
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:52.890
To then I'm trying to have that as my baseline offer even after like you. The discovery art code is still need to run. So, yeah, yeah.

96
00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:03.000
But that's, that's fine. I'll be there isn't, you're saying it should be like in that we have. It's like when I click it, it is. It's what my intention is there.

97
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.610
Within sort of automation. I want to intervene in between because of some purpose for that.

98
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:22.950
So let's say today upgraded version one he will check the letters tomorrow upgraded version to they want to see between version one and two. What are the new errors. Yes. So what are the new things that and that I've come across in this one.

99
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:24.960
So,

100
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.450
I can show you.

101
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.070
Sorry, I had to re login here.

102
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.740
We nothing we could have like a

103
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:44.250
Like a daily job that says, Okay, if Tuesday or see where's the

104
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.760
Computer is acting funny but um

105
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.160
That's a good idea. I see my

106
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.130
Query on CSS upgrade his fast.

107
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.240
And then check whether there's an upgrade and an idea. Good idea.

108
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.870
Yeah, we could do that by now why is

109
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:11.190
That certainly the trigger the trigger here, Lisa. What is it near us

110
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:19.200
So then if you want to kind of see what happens like phone how the manual one then that you can have a snapshot of that particular moment.

111
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:27.540
So, otherwise it's automated and manual. Doesn't matter if it's something similar to what the assumption, Nathan also have so snapshot basic and

112
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:38.880
So whenever there is an actual upgrade and we under discovery, you want to save some information so that even compared with the next upgrades. Man, I would like to say there is a different part descriptors compassion.

113
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:50.010
Here it is more about what of new things happen. Yeah, I mean like data is different. Obviously. Yeah, for data is different and our purpose is different. Only and upgrades. You want to have it really only

114
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:51.750
Only

115
00:21:52.830 --> 00:22:00.030
Only during upgrades. So we need to tag somehow that these are, this is a great time once we click on track now.

116
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:10.410
So from then onwards, maybe can populate some kind of latency, like they should, they should be independent, we can still get on which date on which run how many years we got

117
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:20.760
That information. We still have all we need is just a small difference this is bad. This version that we can use this app version. Yes, you can use that

118
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.390
Streak, and you can't have a trigger. I can, I can show you that trigger

119
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:34.980
And this update history is it for 22 on day Tony Tony Danza trigger that platform generates for you if any upgrade happens. So you can use that as a trigger.

120
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:47.820
To carry the same thing. That's like we have the trigger be using using that for a different purpose, but we can choose. So you should give the Daily News, the same trigger to them. No, no. Yeah, but it was four years with the

121
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:49.980
Trigger projects.

122
00:22:51.210 --> 00:23:09.090
Okay, so right. I think you'll be done this to use trigger with the channel that we need to wait some time. That's what we have like Jim said we have a daily job which checks whether there was an upgrade in the previous day. We wanted to check it, you will give the trigger instantaneously.

123
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.590
Waiting

124
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.520
For you, what do you want to blow my

125
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.420
View the trigger for one day. Yeah.

126
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.180
Yeah.

127
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:41.880
I think if I understand what you're saying is I think there is an upgrade event somewhere in the system and then you would you would some something would watch for that event, and then put in a scheduled put in a scheduled 124 hours in the future.

128
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:52.230
Now it's cool to searching. So there are two things. One is we can we can put in the scheduler.

129
00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:57.090
Or we can write in the program itself. Whenever the event or whenever the upgrade happens

130
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:11.970
The platform will initiate a trigger. So we need to kind of, it's not a pull mechanism. It's more like a push mechanism. So that will push you went back to the program and program can take an action from there. Okay.

131
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.730
So place. But I think the the is, you still need to wait for loss to

132
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:30.210
Upgrade happen is, all of that, how you want to do that. Right. And then here's the 32nd job ready for our future. But we don't go up with a button for ours. We want to know.

133
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.150
The after whenever it is you do we consider implementation plan.

134
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:50.070
But then we have to store the data from that run with the same ID. So when you go to the Delta yeah legal the raw data, we are actually different of London, actually.

135
00:24:51.180 --> 00:25:03.210
Tested and you won't give in terms of error counts or as less than you matters. Basically, every pattern removed, whatever is new. And what is the difference in existing more more on those lines.

136
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:11.460
Right, just before ingest after 24 hours later in the day, we don't have the money we do the last

137
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:24.570
No 124 of us would be very long time, maybe before 24 hours maybe a week before and

138
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.780
All the last of the last time. So you wanted to the veins of

139
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.780
This, if you look at the product you have already read on everyone's

140
00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.610
That means, so that means you need that power to Dave basically when you want to see the your student before how

141
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:55.620
Do we have this we have something called snapshot, but that is not for this purpose, but we have a way to see two different times. Instead, there is something is

142
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.860
It has a manual part to it where you were before, I'm not going. You say save the snapshot and after it again. Good.

143
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.360
Thinking

144
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.780
But every saving for every

145
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.930
Three months or

146
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:28.530
A dumbbell between a blade also either not the days. This is the same day to break that so it is a difference like you depend on. So it depends on the environment. Yeah. Alright, so this is the frequency is more

147
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:45.660
talker. So frequency thing okay different hobbies. Yeah, so that is how we need to do. That is what we have to handle like the frequency that you can do that. So for the first problem I think the answer is simple. This is can you read first

148
00:26:49.140 --> 00:27:01.350
And then make a diff thing also for you to have a better over time. Right. I didn't discuss with this looks better if you added there. So that can be used for other use instead of creating a custom solution.

149
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:13.980
So we appreciate you meeting with you is Jim you're okay with this right you suggested a 24 hour later, we run a that should solve your problem of looking into it. Right.

150
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.450
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, either any of those solutions will work for me.

151
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:19.890
Okay.

152
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.250
Yeah, so probably for the snapshot by

153
00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:33.540
We meet with wise to your team and say what how you would like to have it. Sure. The last time. So we have not seen it operation on the so our

154
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.340
Okay, it's

155
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:43.800
Still not user making the last time and have this question, smart enough worship is what they said, Okay, so we have

156
00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:51.120
We can check. Yeah, we'll discuss on that internally and see where it but ideally we want to leverage that so that

157
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.410
Yeah, if you have some capability better to add their product starting

158
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.650
So if they wanted to put on the check.

159
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.850
Mark. This time you're not used to it. Okay.

160
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:04.710
Yeah.

161
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.440
Okay, nothing.

162
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.600
And regarding the updated version things since we as

163
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.830
I don't know why it was done that way, but

164
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:38.910
Richard version table Jim had pointed out that we have every, every update being tracked. So we were in the conversation we started gym so we either have to create a new table or create the updates and another table so that those updates. Don't get tracked

165
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.590
Okay.

166
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:51.210
We go back to your third of the risk off the table. Yeah, so you're making as references to other people. So it is getting up there doing nothing. Yeah.

167
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.670
There's just so many

168
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.160
Can you show

169
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.480
A lot of records as well.

170
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:05.130
The thing that will immediately impact you is whenever we're looking for whoever change versions during a certain time you'll get

171
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.230
You'll get

172
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.610
Too many off the discovery of the definition paper. Sometimes we

173
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:18.330
look and say, okay, who, who, who changed anything, you know, in that two hour period when things went bad and

174
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.460
It's just a quarter, it's not

175
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.030
I don't think it's immediately hurting anything. I was just

176
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.620
It's just clutter. So

177
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.100
I would say it's not urgent. But I'm pretty

178
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.080
Clean it up, down the road.

179
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:32.670
Okay.

180
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.620
So anything time without the Doctor, thank you. Sure.

181
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:38.880
Thank you very

182
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.080
Good morning.

183
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.710
Good. I think religion.

184
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:50.340
Might be yes. So, so do any actions on the Vizio project, anything that we should look at.

185
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.220
Yeah, so I put some notes up in the channel.

186
00:29:54.930 --> 00:30:01.170
For some reason that s&m he calls from the mid to the target machines.

187
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:09.300
According to the logs have gone from like point two seconds to like 40 seconds. Sometimes

188
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.040
Okay.

189
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:28.740
So I asked such a site is here, though. He's probably asleep now too. But before we went to sleep. He and I were talking a little bit but um I posted some spunk graphs and things like that in the DC upgrade channel and I think it's pretty clear that

190
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.560
s&m P is taking longer than it used to, but I have not

191
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.290
Tim Tim broberg is is grabbing some TCP dumps overnight.

192
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.090
So we're hoping that will tell us more about why that's happening.

193
00:30:50.850 --> 00:31:10.650
So Jim, is it is good performance that particular. What's the reason the method will that help anyway if we can upload that the cluster level on this call status. We have, we have a platform feature right to validate pronunciation time accusation time

194
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.620
Yeah, if you could look at that, when I was thinking about that one AMC

195
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.210
I was

196
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.100
Using show, but if you could look at that one. That'd be great. Because I think that show the same thing.

197
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.490
Okay, sure. I'll take a look on them today.

198
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.620
Cool.

199
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.810
Okay, well thanks a lot, and yeah.

200
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.290
Oh,

201
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:33.960
Thank you.

202
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.420
Good night.

203
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.060
Think in W set up a phone. I mean, the only thing is like

204
00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:03.960
That continuous we're of foods that are reporting, warning, warning and all of that changes before that and we want to identify

205
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:16.350
The have changed. Yeah, what the system is change that's been conducting Greg Whiteley then focus on those. So that's anything expected or not expected that will help us well if you mix of these things.

206
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.910
Is kind of segregate them is a challenge.

207
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.210
Yeah, so here we be looking at Discovery logs already, right, obviously it will

208
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:35.970
Drop some weight but. So as of now, we have to manually see and absorb them. But if the system itself shows up the way that

209
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:41.790
The, the new things, new drivers have not discovered or the, the new earth that have come through or

210
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:49.020
Morning devices may not be convinced cannot be captured from the risk officer again and different mechanisms.

211
00:32:49.650 --> 00:33:05.340
But also look three things that you normally do right we we new devices from the discovery law if it's not being discovered. Can we talk to the CA, which gave the editor and show that this was the device and just thinking, see there are a couple of things.

212
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.390
One is, for example, if a place or something else. If they're all rights, the file. Yeah.

213
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:24.000
So then the discord might not happen. Okay, so there are a couple of qualities is the disco doesn't happen for the dividers. So Daniel. See that file got changed or not.

214
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:38.010
So that is one aspect. The second aspect. If platform. Introducing the new words new patterns new warnings. So we have to see like, what is the frequency how big, how big is it number

215
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.220
And what are the different kinds of devices using the same credit for based on that you have to see.

216
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.900
There's an expected behavior not unexpected behaviour with it's going to fall.

217
00:33:50.790 --> 00:34:05.880
Like any impact on our, on our scoping against the law errors desserts warnings and also God is called may not be so if you're not as good, nice like its own thing in the Delta, you may not find that

218
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.010
Yeah, it's tough for you to find out, but maybe we'll find out in different ways, right there. I didn't burn fortunate problem, we can help and the rest

219
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:22.980
So we have other query within the CI table or maybe table. We can vary on file it all, but these are the common three challenges that we have

220
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:41.970
Right, yeah. So probably when we take it up, we can discuss what is the free upgrade thing. Would you like a week's average over 10 years which have been occurring. We can profit as to how did you play games today your bread. What is your sanity point with with your see

221
00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:58.260
If you see the graduation point of view, right. The first party that we see is the time wise, whether it is taking in Eastern Time. Awesome. This 1pm PM for certain words post here when we get back on and on the same one. We

222
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:08.280
Read it could be before 24 immediately. Immediately before we enable this think that's the first thing. The second thing with the ability to provide has been discord or not.

223
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.020
So the scheduled times discovery.

224
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:21.210
Next comes the herbs and any of the new herbs or patterns that are being created. So there's a top the next spread

225
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:28.560
So maybe if you can handle that, like, once we do that manually. So the bottom two things is that automation can handle that.

226
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.970
So that way it can happen in a single

227
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.340
API, we should be able to select that as a period of the delta

228
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.820
Or video. Yeah. We should be

229
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:52.440
Ready for our third. Yeah. So let's do some yoga probably that before.

230
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.140
We can't see just 24 hours, you might want to see the last one, the

231
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.470
Last 24 hours right

232
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.950
I mean, it's an enabler for you. You may act differently. So we have the parameter

233
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:27.060
Like a plan, you can have a parameter is or he has finished or whatever. So in that way. So the family comes with a design and taken the approach to the first thing is differently. You're funny new person comes in. So the very first class which we can take up is given the trigger, which

234
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:36.330
Is a new thing that can be done. Yeah. So you said that can be done easily that but let's handle that first

235
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.430
This one.

236
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.020
big milestone for Vodafone
